# CSV-Combiner

 ## A simple tool which combines all CSV files in a given directory and combines the values into a new output file. 
 
 Usage:
  - make sure the column headings are the same across all input files.  
  - run the .exe or .ps1 and choose the path where your files exist
  - notice the new output file
 
 Considerations:
 - The utility does not delete the source csv files 
 - the utility assumes the column headings are the same name and order across each input file  
 - the content from each file will be appended to the end of the previous file
