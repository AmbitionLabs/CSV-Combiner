# CSV-Combiner

 ## A simple tool which reads all CSV files in a given directory and combines the values into a new output file. 
 
 How to use:
  - run the .exe or .ps1 and choose the path where your files exist
  - notice the new output file
 
 Considerations:
 - the combiner does not delete or modify the source csv files 
 - the content from each source file will be appended to the end of the previous file within a new file
 - the combiner uses the column headings of the first(alphabetical) csv file processed in the directory you pick, so either make sure each file has the same column headings OR place a dash or underscore at the beginning of the filename you'd like to use as the heading authority. 
 _--Because of this behaviour, the file can also be used as a tool to apply headings to multiple heading-less .csv files._
